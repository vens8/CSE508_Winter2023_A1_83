temperature measurements reversal ii double beam method reversal method previously described using photomultiplier oscillograph modified two light beams employed interference filters used front photomultipliers instead spectrograph one beam background source viewed directly shock tube beam background source viewed shock tube mirror system neutral filter interposed reduce effective brightness temperature suitably chosen temperature background one oscillograph trace indicates absorption indicates emission sodium lines thus possible records single shock determine temperature history behind shock wave nitrogen oxygen show relaxation effects near front temperatures argon tend come low owing radiative disequilibrium excitation processes argon discussed system possible determine temperatures rather higher background source work also done method using carbon arc background following reversal indium blue line temperatures measured shocks nitrogen time resolution good
