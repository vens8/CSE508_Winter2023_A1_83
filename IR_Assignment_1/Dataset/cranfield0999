static aerodynamic characteristics short blunt cones various nose base cone angles mach numbers angles attack tests performed mach numbers determine coefficients normal force axial force pitching moment short blunt cones affected changes nose base cone angles models nose investigated nose models tested flat base base cones nose model base cone reynolds numbers test ranged maximum diameter variations base cone angle resulted significant changes aerodynamic characteristics lesser effects resulting changes nose cone angle particular model conical base one trim angle flat base conical base two trim angles estimated variations aerodynamic characteristics angle attack means modified newtonian theory good agreement experimental results theory however failed predict trim point model
