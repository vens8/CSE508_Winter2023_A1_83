low speed tests sweptback wings report contains results pressure measurements three aspect ratio incidence range chordwise spanwise lift distributions given mostly near centre two wings modifications made section shape found altering thickness distribution centre affect loading approximately straight isobars could obtained values incorporation twist camber central part distortion lift distribution centre could avoided one particular incidence thus chordwise distribution obtained span twist camber alone improve isobar pattern therefore thickness modification would needed give desired lift distribution isobar pattern one particular incidence results experimental investigations boundary layer effect aspect ratio given later report
