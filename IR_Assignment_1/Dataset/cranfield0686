flutter tests simple models mach number helium flow results hypersonic flutter tests simple models presented models rectangular plan forms panel aspect ratio sweepback frequency ratios two airfoil sections included tests double wedges thickness flat plates straight parallel sides beveled leading trailing edges models supported cantilevered shaft wings tested helium mach number effect airfoil thickness flutter speed found thicker wings requiring stiffness avoid flutter tests air mach number showed thickness effect also indicated tests helium would predict conservative flutter boundaries air data air helium seemed correlated calculations calculations agreed well experiment thinner models began deviate thickness parameter approached exceeded tests models various locations made calculations would satisfactorily predict flutter models probably blunt leading edges
