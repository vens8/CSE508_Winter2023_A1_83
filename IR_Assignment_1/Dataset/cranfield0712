longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated series ratio wings variations contour investigation conducted various reynolds numbers low subsonic speeds determine longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated series wings variations contours planforms included highly swept triangular wing rectangular wing intermediate wings including planforms elliptic parabolic contours aspect ratio effects changing aspect ratio given contour investigated two wings presented also included longitudinal characteristics associated various fuselage sizes effort made estimate lift variation angle attack wing planforms present investigation improvements lifting capabilities low subsonic speeds associated basic triangular planform low aspect ratio possible slight alterations design still conform possible design requirements hypersonic speeds changes planform resulted increases slope lift high angles attack maximum untrimmed ratio provided fuselage sufficiently small longitudinal stability characteristics majority planforms indicate desirable stability characteristics high lifts either triangular wing rectangular wing aspect ratio effects increasing reynolds number planforms investigated generally resulted slight reductions lift high angles attack method presented estimating variation angle attack wings present investigation indicated good agreement experimental data throughout range investigation
