study acoustic fatigue characteristics flat curved aluminium panels exposed random discrete noise study made fatigue life simple aluminumalloy panels measuring inches exposed discretefrequency noise siren random noise air jet noise levels varied approximately panel variables included thickness edge conditions curvature differential significant differences noted nature failures experienced two types loadings given stress level failure times generally shorter random loading loading differences failure times noted function stress level larger differences occurring lower stress levels increases time failure obtained result increased panel thickness increased panel curvature particularly increased differential across curved panels loading location weak points simplified structural designs satisfactorily accomplished quantitative predictions fatigue life much difficult
