transonic flow compressible fluid axially symmetrical nozzle method similar developed tomotika tamada quart appl math rev computing mixed isentropic flows sonic region flow vicinity throat axially symmetrical nozzle studied several exact solutions von karman equation axially symmetrical transonic flows obtained one gives flows converging diverging nozzle considered detail solution consists four branches two rejected singularities remaining two branches one gives pure supersonic flow gives taylor type flow local supersonic region throat varying parameter latter branch approaches two asymptotes yield meyer type asymmetrical flows
