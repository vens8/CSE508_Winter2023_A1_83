heat transfer low reynolds numbers measurements local heat flux hemispherecylinder models supersonic rarefied air stream presented two different methods developed five individual models used data obtained throughout mach number range reynolds numbers based conditions behind bow shock model diameter varying stagnation point data indicated gradual increase continuum boundary layer theory higher reynolds numbers lower end range investigated pressure distribution measurements cooled uncooled models found agree well modified newtonian theory local recovery factor measurements showed small rarefaction effect lowest reynolds numbers
