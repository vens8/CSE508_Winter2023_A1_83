theoretical pressure distribution combination recent years great use made approximate methods determination pressure distribution bodies afterbodies high mach numbers bodies suggested modified newtonian theory combination expansion used nose portion two laws matched point pressure gradients equal simple approximation however found bodies pressure distribution afterbody analogy suggested general nose shapes particular afterbody profiles purpose present note compare approximate estimates accurate determination flow field ideal gas flow felt since experimental investigations air mach number scarce difficult obtain comparison would interest basis comparison flow field results numerical integration exact equations governing motion ideal fluid
