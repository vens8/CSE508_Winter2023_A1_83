analysis aircraft structures two methods presented analysis complex aircraft structures methods provide arbitrary external loading general respect orientation structural members permit arbitrary boundary conditions purposes analysis structure idealized network flexural members interconnected torsion boxes first method sets linear equations obtained expressing boundary conditions member deflection equations equilibrium requirements relationships terms deflections internal forces solution deflections internal forces formed product inverse structural matrix column matrix load functions second method conditions given boundary assembled column matrix transferred fashion entire structure opposite boundary transfer accomplished successive multiplications square matrices composed independently different transfer ranges final operation inversion relatively small matrix provides solution unknown boundary conditions comparisons theoretical results experimental data solutions favorable
