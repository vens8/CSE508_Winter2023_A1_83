axisymmetric free mixing swirl viscous laminar small moderate large swirl investigated boundary layer type analysis integral methods moderate small swirls formally differing order associated radial pressure gradients neither induces significant axial pressure gradients consequently effect axial flow negligible moderate small swirl interesting feature swirl decay compressible incompressible flow shown jet swirl decays rapidly wake swirl whereas swirls decay rapidly axial velocity large swirl generates axial pressure gradients well large radial pressure gradients therefore alters streamwise flow examples calculated incompressible flow show wake lengthened large swirl expected effect diminished presence higher mach numbers lead decreased densities due decreased centrifugal effects decreased radial pressure gradients decreased axial pressure gradients
