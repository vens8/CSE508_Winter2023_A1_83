compressible boundary layers bodies revolution former paper shown behaviour laminar boundary layer body revolution described mathematically equations also applied processes laminar boundary layer flow along body contour form determined shape body revolution simple relation exists boundary layers axially symmetrical ones flow assumed incompressible report shall shown relation still valid compressibility taken consideration distribution velocity well temperature laminar boundary layer body revolution calculated solving corresponding problem flow around suitable contour method made clear example supersonic flow towards cone tip example already treated another method hantzsche wendt
