stagnation region rarefied high mach number flow paper describes results numerical solution viscous equations axisymmetric stagnation region using law purpose establish applicability simple approximation obtained earlier air low reynolds numbers low ratios wall temperature stagnation temperature using reference temperature closely equal eckert interpret linear results excellent agreement found limit wide range reynolds numbers covering fully merged shock layers well boundary layers without vorticity interaction agreement recent experiments ferri et al good expected shocklayer approximation paper provides valuable extension applicability reference temperature concept
