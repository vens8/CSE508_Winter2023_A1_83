theoretical studies unsteady transonic flow part iii oscillating low aspect ratio rectangular wing expanding velocity potential asymptotic series aerodynamic forces oscillating low aspect ratio rectangular wing calculated approximate theory valid small values ko ratio k reduced complements earlier theory author valid pointed wings like delta wings present report gives formulas calculation generalized forces smooth flexible rigid mode oscillation spanwise symmetry comparisons theory show except wings low aspect ratio effects appreciable even fairly low reduced frequencies near upper limit ko applicability present theory good agreement obtained recent theory high aspect ratios
