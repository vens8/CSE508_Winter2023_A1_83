effect helium injection axially symmetric stagnation point effective means protecting surface hypersonic vehicle inject small quantities lightweight gas boundary layer porous wall process known cooling protects surface two ways first injected gas coolant passes reservoir wall surface considerable quantity heat absorbed temperature raised reservoir temperature wall surface temperature characteristically lightweight gases relatively high specific heats secondly transfer mass enthalpy convection diffusion normal surface alters characteristics boundary layer manner reduce temperature gradient wall hence conductive heat transfer wall sometimes referred blowing effect
