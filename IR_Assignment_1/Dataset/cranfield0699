approximate indical lift functions several wings finite span incompressible flow obtained oscillatory lift coefficients functions wing undergoing sudden change sinking speed presented delta wings aspect ratios rectangular elliptical wings aspect ratios elliptical rectangular wings spanwise lift distributions also presented functions calculated lift coefficients associated wing oscillating harmonically pure translational motion obtained several sources results calculations indicate normalized functions substantially independent shape plan form elliptical rectangular moderately tapered wings however delta wings increase lift toward value much rapid aforementioned wings aspect ratio results also corroborate results investigations rate growth lift tends increase decrease aspect ratio shape spanwise distributions indicial lift seems practical purposes independent time rectangular elliptical wings
