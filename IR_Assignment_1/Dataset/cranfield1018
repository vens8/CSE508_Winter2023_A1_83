note creep buckling columns results creep tests objective obtaining procedures predicting column lifetime semiempirical lifetime curves obtained aid previously published column creep theory used deriving column curves semiempirical lifetime curves also used study effect varying applied stress range considered small variations found little practical significance whereas small stress variations change column lifetime considerably range encountered tests data presented plots explicitly include plots type satisfactory predicting column lifetime design purposes
