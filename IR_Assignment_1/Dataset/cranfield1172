elastic stability circular cylindrical shells stabilized soft elastic core effect soft elastic core upon buckling strength thin circular cylindrical shell investigated experimentally two types loading considered axial compression b uniform radialband loading width band small compared length shell type loading shown strengthening effect elastic core becomes significant increasing values ratio example shown geometric elastic constants considered possible presence core increase axial buckling stress much percent values found without elastic core elastic core even effective stabilizing shell buckling due band loading peak pressure required buckle filled specimen times required buckle unfilled shell
