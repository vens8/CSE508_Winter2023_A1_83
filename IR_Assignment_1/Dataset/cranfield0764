breathing vibrations circular shell internal liquid resonant breathing frequencies mode shapes determined experimentally circular cylindrical shell containing nonviscous incompressible liquid resonant frequencies determined full shell good agreement predicted reissner vibration theory inclusion term liquid effect internal liquid shell mode shapes significant partially full shell case circumferential node lines tend shift toward bottom filled portion shell excitation motion highfrequency forced oscillation partially filled shell occurred many cases liquid response tentatively explained excited beat frequency forced oscillation similar type response reported yarymovych axially excited rigid tanks
