investigation noise produced subsonic air jet investigate theoretical predictions lighthill aerodynamic sound measurements made sound field air jet issuing long pipe measurements made wide frequency band octave bands frequency range mean mach number pipe orifice varied dependence apparent position noise sources frequency jet speed investigated given frequency source situated farther jet orifice higher jet speed lower frequency sources appear farther downstream ones higher frequency consistent association larger eddies directional characteristics sound field different frequencies jet speeds illustrated means scale diagrams showing lines constant sound intensity sound fields analyzed terms moving quadrupole sources lighthill theory good agreement obtained shown apparent spread sources low frequencies due doppler effect low frequency relative frequency maximum power output radiation predominantly three mutually orthogonal longitudinal quadrupoles except effect convection upon sound field like monopole source higher frequencies sound fields lateral longitudinal quadrupoles predominate
