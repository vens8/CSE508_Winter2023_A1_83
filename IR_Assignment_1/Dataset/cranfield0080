effect distributed roughness surface cooling boundary layer transition lateral spread turbulence supersonic speeds investigation made langley supersonic pressure tunnel mach numbers determine effect distributed roughness transition model surface adiabatic wall temperature cooled effect surface cooling lateral spread turbulence distributed single spherical roughness particles used transition boundary layer determined anemometers mechanism threedimensional roughness supersonic speeds appeared previously observed subsonic speeds fact critical value roughness reynolds number parameter value turbulent spots initiated roughness found approximately supersonic subsonic speeds complete local conditions top roughness including density viscosity considered formulation roughness reynolds number roughness reynolds number less critical value roughness introduced disturbances sufficient magnitude influence transition surface cooling although providing theoretical increase stability small disturbances increase important extent value critical roughness reynolds number roughness particles cooling therefore effect boundarylayer thickness density viscosity actually promoted transition due existing surface roughness given mach reynolds numbers measured lateral spread turbulence boundary layer appeared unaffected increased laminar stability derived surface cooling
