rapid laminar boundary layer calculations application similar solutions method presented rapid calculation incompressible laminar boundary layer arbitrary flow around either body solution obtained without recourse von karman momentum equation means coarse procedure segment velocity distribution approximated one family similar flows solutions least much accuracy approximate method certain cases solutions become exact regions accelerating velocity accuracy appears high decelerating flows separation predicted somewhat early compared exact solutions method conservative contrast von procedure sometimes fails predict separation actually exists method rapid hand procedure known author provided full history boundary layer required thickness needed one point surface equal speed quadrature method several values properties along surface required appreciably faster quadrature method characteristically four steps needed forward stagnation point pressure peak velocitydistribution data available step calculation requires minutes using slide rule
