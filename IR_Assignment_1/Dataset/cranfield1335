use fluid aerodynamic testing thermodynamic properties investigated determine possibilities use gas fluid aerodynamic testing values velocity sound less air presented functions temperatures pressure including measurements room temperature density four times air changes state may predicted means ideal gas law accuracy better percent pressures shown condense adiabatic expansion normal conditions mach number values ratio specific heats lower air therefore additional parameter introduced must considered comparisons made aerodynamic tests using using air time lag vibrational heat capacity change temperature measured found order x second atmospheric temperature pressure time short important energy dissipations result engineering applications
