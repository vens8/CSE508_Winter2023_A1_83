shear buckling clamped infinitely long plates reinforced transverse stiffeners paper presents solution buckling infinitely long plates clamped along edges together extension solution obtained stein fralich case edges shown consequence increasing edge support simple support one deflection rotation prevented rigidity intermediate transverse stiffener must possess order support plate effectively much reduced agreement theoretical relationships existing experimental data good
