analytical treatment aircraft propeller precession instability analytical investigation made instability occur flexibly supported combination means idealized mathematical model comprised rigid system flexibly mounted pitch yaw fixed backup structure conditions required neutral stability determined paper also examines sensitivity stability boundaries changes parameters stiffness damping asymmetries engine mount propeller speed airspeed mach number propeller thrust location pitch yaw axes stability found depend strongly damping stiffness system use nondimensional charts theoretical stability boundaries compared experimental results obtained tests aeroelastic airplane model general theoretical results account wing response show trends observed experimentally however given set conditions calculated airspeeds neutral stability consistently lower measured values evidently result due fact wing response tends add damping system
