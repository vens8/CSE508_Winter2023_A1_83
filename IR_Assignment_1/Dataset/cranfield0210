propeller yaw realized early propeller yaw develops side force like fin harris expressed force terms torque coefficient unyawed propeller several attempts express side force directly terms shape blades however none completely satisfactory analysis incorporates induction effects adequately covered previous work gives good agreement experiment wide range operating conditions presented herein present analysis shows fin analogy may extended form expression effective fin area may taken projected side area propeller effective aspect ratio order appropriate dynamic pressure roughly propeller disk augmented inflow variation inflow velocity fixedpitch propeller accounts variation side force ratio v nd propeller forces due angular velocity pitch also analyzed shown small pitching velocities may actually realized maneuvers exception spin conclusions propeller yaw develops side force propeller yawed propeller experiences pitching moment addition side force pitching moment order moment produced force equal side force acting end lever arm equal propeller radius pitch yaw small possibly negligible formulas propellers yaw derived herein exception compressibility correction series charts derivative calculated therefrom presented without derivation earlier report
