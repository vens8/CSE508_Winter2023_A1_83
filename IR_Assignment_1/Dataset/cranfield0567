aerodynamic characteristics circular cylinder mach number angles attack force tests circular cylinder made langley hypersonic tunnel mach number based diameter angles attack results compared hypersonic approximation grimminger williams young simple modification newtonian flow theory comparison experimental results shows either theory gives adequate general aerodynamic characteristics modified newtonian theory gives accurate prediction pressure distribution calculated crossflow drag coefficients plotted function crossflow mach number found reasonable agreement similar results obtained investigations lower supersonic mach numbers comparison results investigation data obtained lower mach number indicates drag coefficient cylinder normal flow relatively constant mach numbers
