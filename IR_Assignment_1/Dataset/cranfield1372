axially symmetric turbulent compressible mixing presence initial boundary layer recent experimental results shown mixing heterogeneous gases initial velocity ratio close unity occurs faster predicted classical theory theoretical analysis two uniform streams different gases nearly equal velocity performed usual assumptions eddy viscosity prandtl number equal constant shows mixing take place slowly rate corresponding laminar diffusion suggested difference analysis experiment could attributed presence boundary layer experiments purpose note show use classical eddyviscosity law admitting existence boundary layer sufficient explain rapid mixing observed physically instead shown rapid mixing explained basis different law suggested ref conclusions obtained application analysis presented briefly
