effects internal pressure buckling shells bending effect internal pressure buckling cylinders bending investigated means modified donnell equation results indicate maximum critical stress due bending increases internal pressure unlike case pressurized cylinders compression results represent moment significant deformations appear cylinder rather maximum moment able carried may good approximation latter metal cylinders
