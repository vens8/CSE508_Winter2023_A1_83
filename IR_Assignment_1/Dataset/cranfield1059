nonlinear conical spring large symmetric deformations shallow conical shells interest design nonlinear conical disk springs applications uniformly distributed axial load acts inner outer edges edges otherwise free several approximations proposed describe behavior springs first approximation based assumption meridional strains negligible requires shell remain conical deformation also extensional strain meridional lines middle surface vanish another approximation retains assumption shell remains conical first assumption satisfies neither two boundary conditions free edges latter violates condition vanishing moment free edges recently authors presented series solution special case namely case annular plate similar loading numerical solutions shallow conical shell conditions load also obtained examination results indicates meridional bending stresses much smaller magnitude circumferential bending stresses hence present analysis based neglect meridional bending moment
