new theory buckling thin cylinders axial compression bending results experiments axial loading cylindrical shells thin enough buckle elastic limit short buckle euler columns good agreement previous theories based assumptions perfect initial shape infinitesimal deflections experimental failure stresses range theoretical discrepancy apparently considerably greater brass specimens duralumin increases ratio equally great discrepancy observed predicted shapes buckling deflections paper approximate theory developed permits initial eccentricities deviations cylindrical shape considered true instability course impossible conditions stress distribution longer uniform assumed final failure takes place maximum stress reaches yield point effect initial eccentricities large deflections much greater case simple struts measurements initial eccentricities actual cylinders made however shown discrepancies explained initial deviations cylindrical form assumed resolved double harmonic series certain reasonable assumptions made magnitudes components deviations assumptions failing stress found function yield point well modulus elasticity ratio basis tentative design formula proposel involves relations suggested theory based experimental data shown similar discrepancies experiments previous theories buckling thin cylinders pure bending reasonably explained basis maximum bending stress taken times values given equation buckling problems probably explained similar considerations hoped discussion may help open new field study buckling problems theory developed paper useful exploring field may used applications well paper presents results hundred new tests thin cylinders axial compression bending together numerous tests lundquist form experimental evidence conclusions arrived
