behaviour cylindrical shell axial compression buckling load exceeded value compressive stress thin circular cylindrical shell becomes unstable worked theoretically southwell subsequent experimental results however indicated value appreciably high form distortion occurs practice differs assumed theory recent years much work done problem america lundquist donnell concluded buckling cylindrical shell greatly influenced initial irregularities von karman tsien indicated thin cylindrical shell maintained buckled state compressive load considerably smaller previously predicted theory present paper extension work von karman tsien shows smallest load keep thin cylindrical shell buckled condition given southwell result fair agreement experiment cylinder buckled long stresses remain within elastic range material cylinder original stiffness
