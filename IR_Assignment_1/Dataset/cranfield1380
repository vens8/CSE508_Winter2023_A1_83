problem obtaining high ratios supersonic speeds importance lift drag ratio well known aircraft designers since gives great extent aerodynamic efficiency airplane aerodynamic efficiency however one component grand compromise completed airplane represents subsonic speeds ratios well measured wind tunnels airfoil powered aircraft attained lift drag ratio value invariably true requirements stability control structure flight operation contribute reducing design lift drag ratio considerably exotic values predicted unrestricted aerodynamic theory however certain range operating efficiency required certainly minimum examine range equation see range proportional ratio thermopropulsive efficiency logarithm initial final weight ratio appearance ratio linear factor range equation indicates every attempt made increase lift drag ratio however search higher lift drag ratio may lead strange unorthodox configurations frequently configurations ruled adverse effects geometry weight ratios present paper deal maximum ratio problem conventional configurations wing body close proximity attempt made select particular configuration best however promising direction go aerodynamic view stressed understanding factors may outweight aerodynamics
