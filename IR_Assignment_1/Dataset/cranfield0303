effect variable heat recombination stagnation point heat transfer earlier studies assume average heat formation atoms based upon external flow conditions shown equilibrium heat transfer decreases typical mach number case allowance made proportions air components variable recombination energy also results atom mass fractions realistically less equilibrium frozen situations throughout boundary layer
