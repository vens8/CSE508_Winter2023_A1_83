calibration standard head used rae low speed wind tunnels recent results tests wind tunnels concerned measurement pressure distributions shown slight discrepancies readings various static pressure tubes calculated pressure distributions consequence doubt felt concerning calibrations tunnel static pressure upon validity reading given standard head therefore decided check standard head used wind tunnels instrument similar measurements static pressure also made using long tube interference head support calculated small note gives results tests made ft open jet wind tunnel ft wind tunnel order determine necessary correction reading static pressure given head tests made september october
