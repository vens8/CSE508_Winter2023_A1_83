magnetohydrodynamic shock waves earlier attempts finding jump conditions across hydromagnetic shock wave various simplifying assumptions regarding shape shock dimensions character motion made analysis possible write jump conditions higher degree generality shock conditions magnetohydrodynamic flows however derived full generality help transport equation used thomas derivation shock conditions conventional gas dynamics purposes paper cover present general case every flow field quantity downstream shock wave expressible separately terms known values quantities upstream shock wave rearranged form equations various effects shock wave easily read shock conditions along lines conventional gas dynamics
