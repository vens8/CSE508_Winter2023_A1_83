aerodynamic heating blunt nose shapes mach numbers results presented recent investigations aerodynamic heating rates blunt nose shapes mach numbers data obtained flight tests shown cylinder percent heating rates hemisphere nearly entire mach number range tests made mach number series bodies made hemispherical segments varying radius curvature showed slight amounts curvature decrease local rates edge cylinders slight increase stagnation rate total heat transfer slightly curved bodies also somewhat smaller total heat transfer cylinders comparison several tests theoretical distributions showed laminar turbulent local rates predicted available theories pressure distribution reasonably well although scatter available data still leaves open choice theories edge bodies usually differ tests cylinder mach number angles attack showed movement apparent stagnation point center body percent windward station creased percent near leeward edge decreased percent angle attack preliminary results concave nose indicated possibility type design may developed give heating rates significantly lower even cylinder rates test results also shown however existence unsteady flow phenomenon increase heating rates extremely high values
