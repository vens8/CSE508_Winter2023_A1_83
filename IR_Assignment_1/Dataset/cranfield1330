fourier transforms theory flows growth lift airfoil starting impulsively rest uniform velocity given wagner lift due circulation airfoil oscillating sinusoidally moving uniform velocity given theodorsen present paper based essentially material report author discusses reciprocal relations nature fourier transforms existing functions wagner theodorsen kussner already shown wagner function may derived theodorsen function means superposition principle possible utilize fundamental functions treat general problems transient expression accurate within percent given wagner function expression leads good approximate expression theodorsen function terms exponential integral instead hankel functions analogy drawn transient hydrodynamic flows transient electrical flows kussner introduced function describing growth lift airfoil entering sharp edged vertical gust region function bears certain relation wagner function briefly discussed
