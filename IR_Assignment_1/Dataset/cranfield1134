torispherical shells caution designers recently become apparent rigorous stress analysis specific case designing torispherical shells current edition asme code unfired pressure vessels lead failure vessel purpose present paper show respects code fails give accurate results illustrative example hypothetical pressure vessel torispherical head ratio selected supports vessel considered either main cylinder around torus vessel subjected internal pressure elastic stresses determined rigorously code comparison two revealed code predicted stresses head less one half actually occurring furthermore code gave indication presence high compressive circumferential direct stresses exceeded psi practically entire torus head fabricated using steel yield point would failed undergone large deformations whereas code would predicted safe code rules torispherical heads thus need revision certain geometries implications foregoing results currently studied asme interim however designers exercise care applying code torispherical shells also shown paper use membrane state particular solution differential equations good approximation toroidal shells type considered
