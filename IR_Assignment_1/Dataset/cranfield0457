laminar flow near position separation singularities considered solution laminar equations position separation singularity type considered occurred careful numerical computation hartree linearly decreasing velocity distribution outside boundary layer may occur generally whenever occur equations cease valid near separation upstream side also downstream separation work suggests singularities may arise solution parabolic equations due formulae found may help computers laminar boundary layers desire rough solution aim
