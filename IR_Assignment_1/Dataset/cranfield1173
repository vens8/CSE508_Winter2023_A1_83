buckling cylindrical shells longitudinally varying loads two problems illustrating effect nonuniformity loading buckling characteristics circular cylinders investigated first problem deals effect linearly varying axial compressive stress would produced weight propellant engine case results indicate ratio maximum critical compressive stress induced shear load critical uniform compressive stress varies curvature parameter z equal z becomes infinite particular increase stress less per sq z greater stability thin cylinders loaded lateral external pressure varying linearly longitudinal direction also investigated results indicate z greater buckling coefficients proportional square root z
