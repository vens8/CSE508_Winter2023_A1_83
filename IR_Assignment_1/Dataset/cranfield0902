current proposed investigations flow slender delta wings unsteady motion practical need research aerodynamics slender delta wings unsteady motion emphasized recent paper zbrozek two important aspects formation presence vortices oscillatory transient modes longitudinal chordwise bending first aspects already briefly discussed ref one feature flow vortices seems particular significance dynamic behaviour wing shedding vorticity leading edge well trailing edge motion distortion wing leads change rate vorticity shed conventional types flow free vorticity shed trailing edge diminishing influence wing free vorticity shed leading edge passing downstream remains close upper surface wing might expected although magnitudes unsteady forces may greatly affected slender delta time delays associated forces may significantly different attached separated regimes flow
