aerodynamic effects configuration variables aeroelastic characteristics lifting surfaces mach numbers results flutter tests simple models given one set models square planform airfoils four different values trailingedge radii percent chord airfoil thicknesses mach numbers frequency ratio set models tapered planform airfoils thicknesses percent chord tested mach numbers frequency ratio tests indicate general increasing thickness destabilizing effect higher mach numbers stabilizing subsonic transonic mach numbers airfoils prone flutter airfoils comparable stiffness levels increasing airfoil bluntness stabilizing effect flutter boundary supersonic speeds negligible effect subsonic speeds however increasing bluntness may also lead divergence supersonic speeds results calculations using aerodynamics conjunction analysis analysis compared experimental results airfoils supersonic speeds analysis accurately predicted flutter characteristics models whereas analysis somewhat better models analyses agreement experimental results improved increasing mach number general methods analysis gave unconservative results respect experimental flutter boundaries
