waves supersonic flow chapter shall mainly consider problems steady plane supersonic flow using fact case steady wave system shall find solutions indirect approach shall first study conditions simple stationary waves may exist flow find flow boundaries correspond may fitted procedure limited upstream influence supersonic field helpful allows flows analyzed constructed step step method possible subsonic case
