compressive torsional buckling cylinders yield region based assumptions led best agreement theory test data inelastic buckling flat plates general set equilibrium differential equations plastic buckling cylinders derived equations used obtain solutions compressive torsional buckling long cylinders yield region test data presented indicate satisfactory agreement theoretical factors cases difference results exists test data substantially better agreement results obtained use law rather law transform axial data shear data
