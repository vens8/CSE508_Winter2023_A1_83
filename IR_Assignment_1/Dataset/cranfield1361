large deflections structures subjected heating external loads method direct formulation stiffness matrix extended include effects nonuniform heating large deflections purpose develop analytical tool treatment actual structures solution aeroelastic problems relations forces deflections must determined usual stiffness matrix formulation relationship limited small temperature changes small deflections large temperature changes additional terms required also problem becomes geometrically nonlinear large deflections involved overcome inherent difficulties nonlinear problem practical structures either iterative procedure must used relations necessary iterative approach derived axially loaded member plate element including effects thermal strains
