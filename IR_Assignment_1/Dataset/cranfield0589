stall surge phenomena axial flow compressors observations rotating stall shown wide variety stall patterns possible anemometer data multistage compressor shown stall low speeds amplitude flow fluctuations increases magnitude first stages diminishes rapidly small value latter stages analysis shown rotating stall exist large portion compressor map low speeds instigated almost simultaneously compressor surge high speeds blades failures attributable resonant vibrations excited rotating stall experienced single multistage compressors analysis deterioration stage performance due unsteady flow resulting stall adjacent stages considered general pressure drop stall point believed much larger indicated analytical formulation compressor performance compressor surge attributed limit cycle operation compressor stall point indicated compressor tests tests small compressor discharge receiver volume may result simply stall compressor without cyclic characteristics compressor surge event engine operation limited large drop performance accompanies compressor stall
