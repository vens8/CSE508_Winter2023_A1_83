simple shear flow past flat plate incompressible fluid small viscosity study viscous flow past body usually necessary consider curved shock wave emitting nose leading edge body consequently exists inviscid rotational flow region shock wave boundary layer situation arises instance study hypersonic viscous flow past flat plate situation somewhat different prandtl classical problem prandtl original problem inviscid free stream outside boundary layer irrotational hypersonic problem inviscid free stream must considered rotational possible effects vorticity recently discussed ferri libby present paper simple shear flow past flat plate fluid small viscosity investigated shown problem treated approximation novel feature free stream constant vorticity discussion restricted incompressible steady flow
