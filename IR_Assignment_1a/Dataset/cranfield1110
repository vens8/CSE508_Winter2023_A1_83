supersonic flow past slightly yawing cone paper concerned motion circular cone blunt angle air high speed direction motion cone coincides axis symmetry resulting air flow well known consider perturbation produced small case cone moving quite direction axis results confirmed experimentally applications ballistics though concerned latter may also useful providing check various approximate methods wider applicability square yaw neglected approximation validity discussed similar methods applied effects yaw also ballistic significance computations yet completed observed lack symmetry flow neither irrotational isentropic
