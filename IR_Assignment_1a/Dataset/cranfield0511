tunnel tests double cascade determine interaction rotor nozzles supersonic turbine experimental confirmation required supersonic turbine leading edges rotor governs rotor incidence hence gas exit angle nozzles evidence also required rotor incidence allowed adverse effect rotors nozzle flow even rotors large turning angle present test cascade represented stationary configuration turbine nozzle mach number swirl angle rotors designed operate relative mach number provide turning angle tests fully supersonic flow could established system losses fairly high increase loss per cent would caused choking rotor
