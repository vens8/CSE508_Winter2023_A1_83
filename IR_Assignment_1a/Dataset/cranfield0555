closing reply comments generalized heat transfer formulas graphs nose cone atmosphere recent paper detra hidalgo shown boundary layer turbulent heat flux per unit area sonic point nose cone may exceed corresponding laminar heat flux per unit area stagnation point ratio turbulent laminar heat flux per unit area estimated vary hemispherical nose reynolds number based nose diameter increases since axisymmetric body surface area vicinity sonic point greatly exceeds area vicinity stagnation point ratio turbulent laminar heat fluxes entire body much greater quoted ratios heat fluxes per unit area
