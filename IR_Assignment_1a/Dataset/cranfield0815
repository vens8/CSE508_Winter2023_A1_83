investigation several blunt bodies determine onic aerodynamic characteristics including effects spinning extendible afterbody flaps measurements unsteady base pressures several blunt bodies shapes may suitable atmospheric reentry vehicles tested determine aerodynamic characteristics shapes angles attack tests conducted transonic mach number range reynolds numbers x x based body diameter rather type shape developed greatest amount static stability largest slopes angle attack maximum lift bodies appears subject mach number effects spinning body longitudinal axis generally increased lift reduced pitching moment angles attack reduced aerodynamic static stability parameter transonic mach number range extension segmented flaps afterbody model served increase lift static stability flaps extended airstream evidence found oscillatory base pressures two dissimilar shapes certain high angles attack highest mach number tests doubt however pressures induce significant oscillatory motion reentry vehicle small amplitude phasing
