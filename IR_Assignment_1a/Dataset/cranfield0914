transtability flutter supersonic aircraft panels certain configurations possible ascertain critical flutter conditions static considerations alone idea simply one negation air speed exceeds certain value statically stable equilibrium sometimes equilibrium take place times dynamics situation complex enough defy tractable analysis value able indicate flutter criterion simpler statics clear suppose flutter begins critical value air speed parameter simply related exceeded show critical value exceeded precludes static equilibrium underlying work premise two critical values assumption begs discussion call lowest value air speed parameter preclude statically stable equilibrium system transtability value cases excess value ban possibility static equilibrium stable call strong transtability value
