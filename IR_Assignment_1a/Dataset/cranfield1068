instability analysis cylindrical shells hydrostatic pressure determine elastic buckling pressure simply supported cylindrical shells subjected lateral axial hydrostatic forces various versions linear bending theories employed past certain shell dimensions however expressions commonly used may yield substantially differing results follows recent work problem armenakas writer briefly reviewed work consisted primarily employing general bending theory circular cylindrical shells influence initial stress developed earlier authors problem mentioned compare results previous investigations outcome establishment simple accurate expression buckling pressure applicable wide range shell dimensions
