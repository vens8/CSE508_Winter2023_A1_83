stresses small displacements shallow spherical shells purpose present paper derive system equations used analysis shallow segments thin elastic spherical shells segment called shallow ratio height base diameter less say results obtained basis assumption often also applicable shells shallow namely loads stresses effectively restricted shallow zones problem spherical elastic shell subject numerous researches rotationally symmetric case fundamental results obtained starting point many applications possible deduce results approximate equations equivalent part follows believed present approach problem shallow shell may interest even rotationally symmetric cases number investigations concerned shell loaded symmetric manner general form problem quite difficult results far obtained easy apply restricting attention shallow shell manner present paper brings considerable simplification analysis
