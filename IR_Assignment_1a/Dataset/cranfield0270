combined free forced convection laminar magnetohydrodynamic flow heat transfer channels transverse magnetic field combined free forced convective heat transfer vertical channels studied many researchers due need engineering design information many papers concerning cases fully developed flow varying wall temperature forced flows channel electrically conducting fluid transverse magnetic field studied large effects magnetic field flow pattern established flows combined free forced convection electrically conducting fluids vertical channels transverse magnetic field expected attract attention future engineering applications example generator plasma studies however except report gershuni zhukhovitskii concerning particular case general study published paper general treatment fully developed free forced convective laminar magnetohydrodynamic flow vertical channel transverse magnetic field includes combined free forced convective flows channels without magnetic field reported ostrach tao etc special cases hartmann flow included limit
