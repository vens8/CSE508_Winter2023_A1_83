air pressure cone moving high speeds cone considered moving velocity higher sound front shock wave moving speed cone first part paper case investigated mathematically flow irrotational pressure velocity density air stream constant surfaces cones coaxial moving solid cone complete solution obtained numerical form cones angle paper results compared experiment respect pressure distribution measured wind tunnel also cone comparison photographs bullets flight latter case theory applicable speed times velocity sound fact found photographs nature wave alters velocity exact solution found compared approximation given recently karman moore valid thin bodies fact agree well case cone angle diverges increasingly truth angle increased
