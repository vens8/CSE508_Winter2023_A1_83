compressible flow applied magnetic field laminar equations formulated solved flat plate compressible air flow equilibrium dissociation ionization assumed applied magnetic field component normal plate proportional heattransfer characteristics determined velocities meters sec magnetic fields results show skin friction heat transfer given velocity decrease increasing magnetic field strength percentage reduction constant along length plate also exhibit hysteresis behavior first found case magnetoaerodynamic couette flow however flat plate hysteresis effect disappears higher mach number furthermore found reduction heat transfer increasing field strength opposite behavior couette flow
