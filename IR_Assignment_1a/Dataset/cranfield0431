measurements drag base pressure wind tunnel interference model five models flown measure drag body base pressure standard wind tunnel interference model mach number range roughness bands wings body model shown produce small definite increase drag mach numbers measured drag fair agreement corresponding measurements made various transonic tunnels differences could plausibly explained effects tunnel interference effect simulated wind tunnel support sting shown increase base pressure discrepancy models without sting greatest subsonic speeds progressively decreases increasing mach number sting effect base pressure
