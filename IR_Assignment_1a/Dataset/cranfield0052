procedure calculating flutter high supersonic speed including camber deflections comparison experimental results method may used high supersonic mach numbers described calculating flutter speed wings camber deflection modes normal coupled vibration modes wing used derive equations motion chord deflections vibration modes approximated polynomials wing may control surface may carry external stores although aerodynamic forces stores presented aerodynamic forces assumed acting wing obtained piston theory also form theory steady flow airfoil shape thickness effects taken account analysis method used calculate flutter speed wings previously tested mach numbers comparison calculations experiment made delta wings also untapered sweptback wing
