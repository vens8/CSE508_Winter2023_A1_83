smallest height roughness capable affecting transition investigation made determine smallest size isolated roughness affect transition layer critical heights three types roughness found wind tunnel types spanwise wires discs sandpaper type addition type roughness test variables included location roughness pressure distribution degree tunnel turbulence length natural laminar flow satisfactory correlation parameter found roughness reynolds number based height roughness flow properties height value critical reynolds number found substantially independent test variables except shape roughness parameter also correlates well published data critical roughness flow value roughness reynolds number necessary move transition forward roughness also determined three types roughness found approximately constant given type roughness investigation limited amount available data critical roughness supersonic flow indicates effects roughness may still correlated roughness reynolds number value reynolds number depends primarily mach number top roughness mach number greater roughness reynolds number based conditions behind shock probably characteristic parameter
