numerical solution equations flow around circular cylinder reynolds number steady flow around circular cylinder submerged viscous fluid case r investigated integrating numerically exact equations main results follows steady flow solution exists even reynolds number high moreover seems solution goes smoothly solution kirchhoff discontinuous flow theory seems limiting flow case r flow pattern coefficients pressure drag good agreement experimental data
