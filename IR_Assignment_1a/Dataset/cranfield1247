supersonic boom projectile related drag volume whitham theory predicting field around projectile used derive body shapes produce extreme bow pressure jump subject constraining conditions regarding drag due bow shock fineness ratio bodies found minimum drag body also minimum boom body effect effect discontinuities slope body meridian section boom intensity investigated general result investigation said boom projectile given mach number flight altitude primarily determined length fineness ratio maximum variation boom intensity pointed bodies given length fineness ratio order per cent geometry bodies thus found play minor role
