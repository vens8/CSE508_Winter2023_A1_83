steady magnetohydrodynamic flow past wedge paper presents study steady twodimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow infinitely conducting fluid past nonconducting wedge nonaligned flow magnetic field flows considered fully hyperbolic regime flows consist several regions uniformity connected shocks expansion waves boundary condition magnetic field magnetic field must regions wedge thus flows regions coupled unlike case ordinary supersonic gasdynamics small wedge angles weak waves characteristics considered problem thus linearized explicit solutions obtained qualitatively similar nonlinear solutions interesting unexpected features arise discussed detail
