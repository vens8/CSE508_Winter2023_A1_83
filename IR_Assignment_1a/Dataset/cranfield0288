rolling trailing vortex sheet effect downwash behind wings motion trailing vortices associated lifting wing investigated theoretical methods purpose determining proper vortex distribution used downwash calculations subsonic supersonic speeds considered analysis found degree vortices rolled depends upon distance behind wing upon lift coefficient span loading aspect ratio wing rolling trailing vortices associated wings little practical importance shown wings trailing vortex sheet may become essentially rolled two trailing vortex cores within chord length trailing edge downwash fields associated two limiting cases flat vortex sheet fully vortices investigated detail subsonic supersonic speeds intermediate case process partially completed tail position also discussed
