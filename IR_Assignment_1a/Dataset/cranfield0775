studies two dimensional flows compressible fluid flow everywhere subsonic field flow nature isentropic flow compressible perfect fluid differs slightly corresponding flow incompressible perfect fluid thus case calculate field flow methods approximation hand flow supersonic throughout field determine flow pattern method characteristics
