pressure distributions three bodies revolution determine effect reynolds number including transonic speed range paper presents results investigation conducted langley transonic tunnel determine effects varying reynolds number pressure distribution transonic body revolution angles attack transonic speed range effect change sting cone angle pressure distributions comparison experimental incremental pressures theory also included models tested mach number range reynolds number range based body length x x diameter x x model angle attack increase reynolds number x x affected longitudinal pressure distributions slightly effects nature cause increase normalforce coefficient body tested subcritical reynolds number range increase agreement theoretical approximations comparison experimental theoretical values incremental pressure coefficient due angle attack indicated good agreement except angles separated flow areas existed body effect change angle pressure distribution model negligible mach number mach number effect cause small increase velocity rear body
