hodographic transformation transonic flow author studies problem finding shape symmetrical nozzle velocity along axis specified velocity along streamline assumed increase steadily singularity sonic velocity axis nozzle first studied physical plane using power series hodograph plane two characteristics hodograph differential equation passing sonic point lines branch points region lines region stream function outside region also singularities sonic point point corresponding specified condition exit nozzle author proposes construct hodograph plane exit velocity finite sum regular throughout sin r square velocity hypergeometric functions fixed required approximation specified velocity distribution along axis solution convergent represents except region near sonic point nozzle excluded region author inverts solution obtain power series shown convergent region interest type solution considered author gives nozzle infinitely long supersonic part
